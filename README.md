This is a chat application that allows you to chat and send money to each other using a Solana wallet. The app has a feature where you can track all transactions separately for each friend. Each friend has a dedicated column that shows all transactions between you and them.

ðŸ’«You can easily track every transaction with each friend, something traditional wallets don't offer, where you can't see how many times you've sent money to a specific user.

ðŸ’«If the particular user is not in your chat you can search your friend by typing the full username of your friend so that nobody can randomly message you and all usernames are unique
